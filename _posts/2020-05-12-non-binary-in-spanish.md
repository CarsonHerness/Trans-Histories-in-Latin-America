## Gender in Spanish Grammar

Spanish is a gendered language. Nouns and adjectives have genders, and the article used with the noun and vowel at the end of words determine its gender. For example, the word for friend, _amigo_, is a masculine noun, and _amiga_ is the feminine version. The final vowel generally signifies the gender, _o_ for masculine and _a_ for feminine. Grammatically, the masculine form of a word is the default and used to describe groups of persons of multiple genders. _Amigos_ means friends of any gender while _amigas_ is multiple female friends. Note that I have greatly oversimplified Spanish grammar here, but this basic understanding of gender in the language gives you a basic understanding of how gender neutral Spanish works. Learn more about gender in Spanish grammar [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender_in_Spanish).

For transgender people, gendered languages present a unique challenge, since adjectives used to describe them are also gendered, beyond gendered pronouns and some gendered words. In English, only pronouns and some words like mother/father, brother/sister are gendered. In Spanish, many adjectives used to describe a person are gendered, including old (_viejo_) and fun (_divertido_), so a transgender person cannot avoid being gendered (or misgendered) whenever someone, including themself, is talking about them. 


## Non-binary people and Spanish

For non-binary people or people who don’t use binary pronouns like he or she, this also means that there may not be an “official” grammatical option for them in Spanish.

As a Spanish student in high school, I was told that gender-neutral language did not exist in Spanish. My friend’s professor told her that non-binary gender identities were an “American culture phenomenon” and that there were no translations for gender-neutral pronouns used in English. We know that non-binary genders are not an “American culture phenomenon.” View Jordy’s post on studying gender non-conforming individuals [here]({% post_url 2020-04-27-how-to-study-gender-noncomformity-in-pre-columbian-america %}), and check out [this Spanish Wikipedia article on non-binary gender identities](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9nero_no_binario).

Despite these misconceptions about gender-neutral language, activists and academics have used different methods to make Spanish speech gender-neutral. The “@” symbol or an “x” are used to replace the final vowel of a word, as in Latin@ or Latinx. Recently, “e” has been used more generally, for its ease in pronunciation and coherence with existing grammatical structures.

## Official use of non-binary pronouns

_The New York Times_ reported in April of 2020 that the [Argentinian president used gender neutral language in an official speech to the country](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/world/americas/argentina-gender-language.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&fbclid=IwAR2eDIE7e3AcxXdwIKbLULUutJx7xgqCIlFYWuLlMbVdivmoK2H_o4MhSeU).[^1]
