Laws pertaining to transgender people have changed rapidly in the last few years around the world, especially in Latin America. Here, I will focus on a person’s ability to change their legal name and sex/gender. This will include the written laws in a country as well as the lived experience of transgender people in that country.

I distinguish between sex and gender here because some countries, states, provinces, and/or municipalities distinguish between them in their policies.

As I was doing research for this post, it became clear that my original goal was a lot more complicated than I had realized. One cannot easily define the legal experience of a transgender person in an entire country. Upon reflection, this is obvious--of course it’s more difficult, if possible at all, to change one’s legal name and gender in different parts of a country. Countries are often broken down into states or provinces, which each have their own laws, and cities often have their own policies as well.

Beyond laws and policies, experience of exercising one’s legal rights vary as well, depending on the municipal office, the judge presiding over a case, or a plethora of other variables which can determine if a trans person is able to change their legal name and sex/gender.

As such, this post presents some research on the experience in different countries, with some recent academic research on the matter.

Research from Baird Campbell published in May 2019 indicates that in all Latin American countries except for El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua, trans people are able to change their legal name. Venezuela, Paraguay, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic in addition to the previously listed countries are not able to change their legal sex.[^1] 

This already shows a dramatic change in comparison to 2014, where research by Jacob R. Longaker and Donald P. Haider-Markel indicated that only Uruguay, Panama, Ecuador, and Argentina allowed their citizens to change their legal names, and Argentina, Cuba, Panama, and Uruguay allowed changes to legal sex.[^2] 

Even though Campbell’s research was published recently in 2019, it already can be out of date.  Additionally, reporting the laws for an entire country oversimplifies the reality for many trans people in many countries, since laws and lived experiences vary greatly between rural and urban areas and across different regions of each country. We’ll look at some recent sources to better understand laws pertaining to trans people’s legal name and gender/sex in a few different countries.


## Mexico

In [this](https://www.milenio.com/politica/comunidad/personas-transgenero-vallarta-facilita-cambio-identidad) recent news article from Mexico, _El Milenio_, reporter Jorge Marínez indicated that some Mexican states allow their citizens to change their legal name and sex.[^3]


## Ecuador

I studied abroad in Quito, Ecuador in Fall 2019, so I know this from my research while I was there, and from my FTM Ecuadorian friends. Technically, the Ecuador Constitution of 2008 prohibits discrimination by gender identity. However, this right is only granted to those who live in Quito or Guayaquil, two of the major cities in Ecuador. 

Currently in Quito, changing legal name and gender is a fairly simple administrative process, but like any administrative process, there can be hiccups in the process. Also, it’s worth noting that while technically Ecuadorians can change their gender on their government ID (their cédula), their updated ID is different than IDs of their cisgender counterparts. After updating their cédula, it reads _Gender: masculine _instead of _Sex: male_, like it does for cisgender citizens (translated from Spanish). Therefore, their IDs outs them as trans to someone who recognizes the difference.

How does this affect transgender people in Quito? Among my friends, most still choose to change their gender on their cédula, because it was something. One refused until the policy changed, since he didn’t want to officially be recognized as a second-class citizen by having a “second-class” marker on his cédula (género).
