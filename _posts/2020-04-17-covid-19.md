COVID-19 has had unique impacts on transgender people, from social distancing policies that are based on gender to health care discrimination that transgender people face when seeking medical care for COVID-19.

### Social Distancing Policies
Colombia has instituted social distancing policies that restrict the days in which their citizens can go out of their homes for essential errands by gender: men can leave their homes on even numbered days and women on odd days.

“Bogotá’s mayor, Claudia López, the first woman and the first openly gay individual to lead the city, has said transgender people can follow the gender with which they identify. The authorities, the health order says, should respect “diverse gender manifestations.””[^1]

“Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch criticized Panama’s gender-separation policy, saying that the police had used it to detain and fine a transgender woman who had left the house on a day assigned to women. The police detained her, said the rights group, “apparently because the ‘male’ gender marker on her ID card did not match her appearance.””[^2]

### Health Care
El Milenio reported on the discrimination that trans people face when seeking medical attention for COVID-19.[^3]
